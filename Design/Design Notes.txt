Design Notes
============

The purpose of this program is to fulfill the need of adding a list of numbers,
but for circumstances where opening an instance of Excel would be a waste of
resources.  As such, this program will need to be small and lightweight.

At the same time, certain visual design features, namely the seven-segment
number display and scrollable tape, will be retained to make this program
unique.  These features were inspired from the Visual Basic 6.0 version of this
program that I created some 20 years ago.

The first iteration of this program will work only in standard 1080p resolution
screens on Windows OS; subsequent iterations will consider being DPI-aware, but
will still be restricted to Windows.

This project is targeting .NET 6, which is the current long-term support version
of .NET.

While this project is too small for a complete Clean/Onion architecture, I have
tried to follow a design that will emphasize a separation of concerns.  So, the
UI will be *only* an interface, with no computing logic behind it.  As much as
possible, I want to make the UI features perform as services for the other
components.
